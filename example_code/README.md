# Arduino example code files
Note that the files using PID (proportional-integral-derivative) motor control have the entire PID library pasted into them. This is because Tinkercad does not allow importing of the standard PID library.<br>
If you have downloaded the library on your computer (or added it to your libraries if using the web interface) then you can delete it from the sample code files and simply include the PID library instead.
